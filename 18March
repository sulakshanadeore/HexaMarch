DDL---Drop-----> remove the object (table,view,etc)  from the database, when drop executes successfully the data in that table is also lost and can't be reclaimed.

DML---Delete---> it removes single/multiple rows depending on the condition specified in the delete statement. And if required we can reclaim/undo(rollback) the delete.
