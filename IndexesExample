--Indexes
What are Indexes and Why to use Indexes?
Structure on disk which helps to speed up the retrieval of the rows from the table or the view.
It has keys built using one or more columns from the table or the view.
These keys are stored in B-tree structure that helps sql server to find the row/s associated with the key values quickly and easily.

Types of Indexes:
Clustered: 
One per table, and if primary key is specified then clustered index is 
automatically created.
Clustered indexes store physical table data with themselves and they are updated whenever a new row is added or a row is deleted from the table based on primary key.



Non Clustered:
Any number of non clustered indexes are allowed with sql server.

Indexes must be created on columns which are frequently used in the where clause of the select statement.
